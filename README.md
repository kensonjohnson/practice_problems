# Practice Problems

What started as a repo to keep all of my answers to [these](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Programming-practice-problems-Qp6jAVBXAuDZWiz5x6r9J) problems has now grown into keeping all of my algo and data structure practice.

This repo now contains LeetCode, mock interview, and novel questions and solutions.
