// You are given a 0-indexed integer array piles, where piles[i] represents the
// number of stones in the ith pile, and an integer k. You should apply the
// following operation exactly k times:

// Choose any piles[i] and remove floor(piles[i] / 2) stones from it.
// Notice that you can apply the operation on the same pile more than once.

// Return the minimum possible total number of stones remaining after applying
// the k operations.

// floor(x) is the greatest integer that is smaller than or equal to x
// (i.e., rounds x down).

// Example 1:

// Input: piles = [5,4,9], k = 2
// Output: 12
// Explanation: Steps of a possible scenario are:
// - Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [5,4,5].
// - Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [3,4,5].
// The total number of stones in [3,4,5] is 12.

// Example 2:

// Input: piles = [4,3,6,7], k = 3
// Output: 12
// Explanation: Steps of a possible scenario are:
// - Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [4,3,3,7].
// - Apply the operation on pile 3. The resulting piles are [4,3,3,4].
// - Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [2,3,3,4].
// The total number of stones in [2,3,3,4] is 12.

const test1 = [5, 4, 9]; // k = 2 expect 12
const test2 = [4, 3, 6, 7]; // k = 3 expect 12
const test3 = [4122, 9928, 3477, 9942]; // k = 6 expect 8768
